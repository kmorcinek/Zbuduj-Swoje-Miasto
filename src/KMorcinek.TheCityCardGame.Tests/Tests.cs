//        In The City, players try to quickly and skillfully build their own city over the rounds, bringing in revenue and victory points (VPs). The cards are both buildings
//        and currency, and the first player to collect 50 victory points wins the game. Victory points are cumulative from round to round, so a fast start yields a big advantage.

//Each turn, each player places a card from his hand face down, then all cards are simultaneously revealed. The cards show the buildings that the players want to build 
//        that round; building costs are paid for by discarding other cards. Some buildings provide income at the end of the round in the form of new cards, 
//        with certain buildings increasing the income provided by others; similarly, some buildings boost the VPs provided by others, with a University, for example, 
//        being worth one more VP for each School you have in play.

//Certain buildings have symbols on them – car, fountain, shopping cart - and the income and VPs provided by some buildings depends on how many symbols you have in play; 
//the Autobahn, for example, is worth one dollar (i.e., card) and one VP for each car symbol you control.
